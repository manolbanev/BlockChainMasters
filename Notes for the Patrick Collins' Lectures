Lesson 1 -Blockchain Basics- :

Smart Contracts - set of instructions executed in a decentralised way without the need for a centralised or third party intermediary.

Dapp = Decentralised Application = Decentralised  Protocol = Smart Protocol

Web1 - The permissionless open sourced web with static content.

Web2 - The permissioned web, with dynamic content. Where companies run your agreements on their servers.

Web3 - The permissionless web, with dynamic content. Where decentralised censorship resistant networks run your agreement and code. It generally is accompanied by the idea of user owned ecosystems, where the protocols you interact with, you also own a portion of, instead of solely being the product.

What is the value of smart contracts?
- Immutable
- Decentralised
- Transparent 
- Trust-minimized agreements 

Transaction Fee = Gas Price x Gas Used

Blockchain:

Genezis Block - the first block in a blockchain

Hash Algorithm - A function that computes data into a unique hash

Blocks - a list of transactions mined together 

Signing Transactions:

Private Key - only know the key holder. Used to “sign” transactions.

Lesson 2 -Welcome To Remix- :

Solidity Modifiers that do not need to send a transaction: view, pure

Types of variables:

Calldata - temporary variables that cannot be modified

Memory - temporary variables that can be modified

Storage - permanent variables that can be modified

Memory: structs, mappings, arrays 

Basic mapping: mapping(key => value) {visibility} {name};

Smart contracts are composable - they can interact with each other.

Lesson 3 -Storage factory- :
Mainly coding. No need for notes for this lesson. 

Lesson 4 -Fund Me- :

Payable - key word that makes a function able to receive ether 

1e18 = 1 ETH = 1x10xx18 —>xx = ^

What is a revert? — Undo any actions that have been done, and send the remaining gas back. 
A reverted TX undos everything in the function but still spends gas.

Transaction fields:
* Nonce — TX count for the account 
* Gas Price — price per unit of gas (In Wei)
* Gas Limit — the maximum gas that this TX can use
* To — dress that the TX is sent to
* Value — amount of Wei spent
* Data — what is sent to the “To” address
* V, r, s — components of TX signature\

Blockchain Oracle — Any device that interacts with the off-chain world to provide external data or computation to smart contracts.

Library — similar to contracts, but you cannot declare any state variable and you cannot send ether. A library is embedded into the contract if all library functions are internal.

For Loop —> for( {start index}, {ending index}, {step} )

Sending Ether:
* Transfer (2300 gas, throws error)
* Send (2300 gas, returns bool)
* Call (forward all gas or set gas, returns bool)

constructor() —> optional function that is executed only upon contract creation.

Modifiers — a way to change the behaviour of functions in a declarative way

Used To:
* Add preconditions
* Add postconditions
* Check certain conditions before executing a function
* Modify the execution flow of the function

Example 1: 

modifier ModifierName(){
//code
_;
}

Executes what is in the modifier first because “_;” is after the code.

Example 2:

modifier ModifierName(){
_;
//code
}

Executes the function first and then what is in the modifier because “_;” is before the code.

Receiving ETH:
* receive() external payable
* fallback() external payable

receive() is called if msg.data is empty, otherwise fallback() is called.

LESSON 6 -Foundry Simple Storage-:
Foundry documentation.

Lesson 7 -FOUNDRY FUND ME-:

When importing “../“ moves a directory upwards(out).

What can we do to work with addresses outside our system?
1. Unit - testing a specific part of our code
2. Integration - testing how our code works with other parts of our code
3. Forked - testing our code on a simulated real environment
4. Staging - testing our code In a real environment that is not prod.


‘’’
vm.startBroadcast;
//code
vm.stopBroadcast;
‘’’
The “vm” functionality is approachable after importing the “Script”.
Everything before “vm.startBroadcast;” is not a real TX and everything after it is a real TX.

No need for notes in this lesson.

Lesson 9 -SMART CONTRACT LOTTERY-:

Layout of Contracts:
* Version
* Imports
* Errors
* Interfaces, libraries, contracts
* Type declarations
* State variables 
* Events
* Modifiers
* Functions

Layout of Functions:
* Constructor
* Receive function (if exists)
* Fallback function (if exists)
* External
* Public
* Internal
* Private
* View and pure functions

Events:
* Allow you to “print” tuff to the log
* Tied to the smart contract 
* Indexed parameters or non-indexed  parameters 
* They can have up to 3 indexed params
* Indexed params are also called topics. Topics are searchable in contrast to the non-indexed params.
